		<p>DMBC is a Dirichlet-Multinomial Bayes Classifier for disease diagnosis with microbial compositions. Our website serves as a tool for you to uplaod your data and simply walk away while the DMBC model is trained.</p>
		<p>To use this tool, please create an account. This to enable users to login and access their current projects. We can also send you an email when your model is trained.</p>
		<p>We ask that your data is pre-processed using either Mothur or Qiime 16S rRNA gene sequence classifiers. You can download our sample <a href="{{ url_for('getfile', filename='training.csv') }}">training</a> and <a href="{{ url_for('getfile', filename='test.csv') }}">test</a> data to use as an example.</p>

		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>Growing interest in microbiome research has yielded data to show that there are associations between microbial community compositions and overall human health. Dysbiosis in microbial communities has been associated with numerous diseases such as autoimmune diseases, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease (Pevsner-Fischer, M et al., 2016).  As the fields of microbial ecology and microbiology shift toward using community compositions as markers of disease, it is important to have freely available tools to aid researchers in identifying biomarkers for disease. Several methods for taxonomic classification exist, many involving Dirichlet-Multinomial models or Bayesian Classifiers. However, the Dirichlet-Multinomial Bayes Classifier (DMBC) algorithm offers superior accuracy in identifying healthy versus diseased microbial communities (Gao et al., 2017). Additionally, this method offers comparatively shorter run times. The DMBC algorithm is currently available as a series of R scripts. To use this tool, one must download the R package and understand how to run a series of commands on their own data through R. Here we present a web-based version of the DMBC package. A web-based implementation allows users to run the DMBC package remotely, removing the need to be familiar with R or to have dependencies installed on a local machine.</p>
